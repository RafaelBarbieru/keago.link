# KEA GO!
KEA Go! is a URL shortener with the quirk that the endpoints generated are easily rememberable and short english words.
Instead of a URL like "https://acesse.one/zfiGd", KEA Go! would generate something like "https://keago.link/speed".
This was the final project for my Bachelor Degree in Software Development at KÃ¸benhavns Erhvervsakademi (KEA).
